Ask Keenan if I can get a better picture of the Keenan Cow.
I should ask what he thinks of my choice of illustrative images. Are some of them useless? Do they each need to be there.


Should I define Extraordinary Vertices?


Here is a list of illustrations I would like to create to make my points clearer.


1. A diagram of local coordinates on a patch.
2. Diagram the bezier basis curves.
3. Make a nice diagram of the definition of the visibility function. With a nice eye vector and tangent vector on the plane.

// FIXME: Should I call 'slid

Make an illustration of projecting 3D curves onto a view plane.

Tommorrow:
Discuss the algorithms for finding the critical points of the visibility function.
Write the discussion of Curve Projection.
